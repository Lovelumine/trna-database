###   tRNA Therapeutics

Suppressor tRNAs \(sup\-tRNAs\) are natural or engineered tRNAs capable of translating termination codons or mutated genes, and have shown promising applications in nonsense mutation disease therapy and unnatural amino acid protein synthesis\. This section focuses on research examples of using sup\-tRNAs to suppress nonsense mutations in vivo, and contains key information such as sequence and structure information, experimental reaction system, and through\-reading efficiency of 700 sup\-tRNAs for termination codons, including 13 models of six related diseases in six species; you can use this database as a reference to select the appropriate sup\-tRNAs for your research, or use its large amount of data as a reference to conduct research on sup\-tRNAs\. or optimize the activity of sup\-tRNA and design from scratch based on its large amount of data\.

#### Step 1 Select the target disease, model and presentation details

Users can click on tRNA Therapeutic to jump to the page, where they can select the disease for research purposes, the relevant model, or retrieve the information quickly through the search function\. Users can also independently select the information they want to display for research purposes\. Users can view the contents of each column individually to quickly get the information they need，Also, ask the artificial intelligence assistant "yingying" can also help to complete the search quickly\.

#### Step 2 Use the filter function to obtain the target disease

The user selects the desired line of information and clicks on the "\+" sign in front of the line of information to jump to the page with the relevant information, which contains information about the disease, including information about the disease mutation, sup\-tRNA treatment information, and we have specifically numbered each of the different sup\-tRNAs to differentiate the sup\-tRNA entries\.

Tools are used to present the original sequence, and the modified sequence in a secondary as well as tertiary structure to show the rationality of the modification, and the user can directly click on the desired information to get the relevant details and provide the user with new ideas\.
