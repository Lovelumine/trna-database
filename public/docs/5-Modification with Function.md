### tRNA elements

tRNAs perform different physiological functions, in which tRNA modifications, bases at key sites, and other proxies play important roles in interactions with EF\-Tu, the aminoacyl tRNA synthetase\(aaRS\), and in specific physiological functions\. This section contains three parts: tRNA Function and Modification; aaRS Recognition; EF\-Tu, A\-site, P\-site and E\-site recognition\.

#### 5.1 tRNA Function and Modification

tRNA Function and Modification section that integrates information on more than 50 different tRNA modifications, corresponding tRNAs, modification sites, situation\-specific functions or characterizations\. Users can learn more about the tRNA modifications that have been studied\.

#### 5.2 aaRS recognition

This part summarizes 105 key sites and bases for tRNA recognition of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase by analyzing more than 100 literatures, covering 22 kinds of tRNAs with amino acid orthologs, and dividing the sites into 4 tRNA secondary structure domains by corresponding the sites to the structures, so that the users can get the key recognition bases and sites for tRNAs and aminoacyl tRNA synthetase quickly\.

#### 5.3  EF-Tu, A-site, P-site and E-site recognition

This part summarizes the key sites and bases for the mutual recognition of tRNA with elongation factor EF\-Tu, as well as with the A\-site, P\-site and E\-site of ribosome, which is a total of 24 key sites, and the secondary structure covers the 4 structures of tRNA, including the accepter stem, the D stem, and the anticodon stem, etc\., which are shown on the diagram\. It helps users to quickly determine the key sites of tRNA and the retention or non\-retention of bases, which is of guiding significance in the process of tRNA synthesis\. 

#### Step 1: Search for tRNA modifications or corresponding functions of interest and study cells, etc.

Users can click tRNA elements to enter the page, and in the tRNA Function and Modification section, they can use the search function to retrieve the required information such as modification types \(symbols mentioned in modomics\), functions, research cells, etc\. Users can also use the filter function to streamline the information in the database and keep only the parts of interest such as modifications and functions\. Or users can directly use the FILTER function to streamline the database information and keep only the parts of interest such as modifications, functions, etc\. The intelligent assistant "yingying" is always there to help users\.

#### Step 2: Look further into the relevant details

Users can click on the “\+” sign in front of the index entry to expand the entry and view the details, including the function corresponding to the modification, the cells in which the function was studied, and the corresponding primary literature\. By clicking on the links, it is also possible to jump to references as well as data sources\. Alternatively, The intelligent assistant "yingying" is always there to help users\.

#### Step3： View a map of the key physiological functions of tRNAs in protein synthesis

Users can click on the tRNA binding site diagram, the part of interest, such as type1 type aaRS recognition label, will link the tRNA site correspondingly, which makes it easy for the user to view the recognition site characteristics of this type of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase, different types are labeled using different colors\.

#### step4: Selection of tRNA entry or secondary structure of interest

Under the tRNA element page, users can select the tRNA with the orthologous amino acid of interest through the aaRS Recognition section, and they can also select the secondary structure of interest\. This section displays the key bases paired with the sites and corresponds them to the tRNA secondary structure, and users can directly click on the name of the amino acid to get the related key bases, the corresponding sites As well as the secondary structure in which it is located, the same amino acid represents more than one orthologous tRNA\.

#### step5: expand and view details

Users can click on the "\+" sign before the selected entry to expand the information of the entry, where they can see more clearly the tRNA set corresponding to the amino acid and the corresponding details\. You can also click the corresponding PMID to jump to Pubmed and get the original literature\.
