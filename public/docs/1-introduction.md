### 1. Introduction

This section provides a brief introduction to ENSURE so that users are aware of the information provided by ENSURE, how to refer to it and how to contact us.

#### 1.1 About ENSURE

ENSURE is an encyclopedia of suppressed tRNA therapeutics equipped with an artificial intelligence assistant. It contains genetic variants in genetic diseases and cancers from the HGV and COSMICS database, including those caused by missense, nonsense, and shifted-code mutations. ENSURE integrates relevant disease therapeutic tRNAs $sup\-tRNAs$ mentioned in the literature, naturally-occurring functional sup-tRNAs, and provides detailed information on the species of origin, sequence, and structure of sup-tRNAs. This platform can help researchers to rapidly identify the biological mechanisms and applications of sup-tRNAs, while providing abundant data resources and analysis tools to support the design of engineered tRNAs.

#### 1.2 Sections of ENSURE

The current version of ENSURE contains four sections:

1. Mutation-induced Disease: Coding Variation in Disease provides data of **380 genetic disorders** caused by **68 nonsense mutations, 214 missense mutations, and 98 frameshift mutations**. In addition, the Coding Variation in Cancer contains lots of cancers with **1,772 records** from the COSMICS database, covering five mutation classes and extensive annotations.

2. Natural sup-tRNAs: Natural sup-tRNAs are included and categorized into two modules according to the type of suppression: nonsense mutation suppressor tRNAs $Nonsense Sup\-tRNAs$ and frameshift mutation suppressor tRNAs $Frameshift Sup\-tRNAs$. The module contains information on **86 natural sup-tRNAs** from a variety of species across **58 publications**, including humans, plants, and microorganisms.

3. Engineered sup-tRNA: integrates **60 articles from PubMed database**, and displays **1,108 sup-tRNA entries** for nonsense mutations. By combining RNAcentral and GtRNAdb with Blastn processing to obtain raw sequences to compare sequence mutation sites, and using tRNAscan-SE combined with modeRNA and AlphaFold3 to obtain secondary and tertiary structures of tRNAs, which provides design guidance for users.

4. tRNA Element: tRNA Function of Modification section deals **249 documents** through AI-assisted processing, providing information on studies related to more than 50 tRNA modifications, including modification sites, details of tRNA that is researched and the functions. And aaRS Recognition section summarizes **101 key sites** and bases involved in tRNA recognition by aminoacyl tRNA synthetase, derived from an analysis of over 100 literatures, covers 22 types of tRNAs with their corresponding amino acid orthologs and categorizes these sites into four tRNA secondary structure domains. Besides, we collect the key recognition elements and sites about tRNA and elongation factor EF-Tu (**60 sites**), as well as the key recognition elements and sites during protein synthesis with ribosomal A-site, P-site and E-site, among which, **58 sites** were collected, and were displayed on the graphs, with different colors and labels. This organization allows users to quickly identify the critical key elements of tRNA through tRNA synthesis.

#### 1.3 Conclusion

In summary, ENSURE is a comprehensive encyclopedia of integrated tRNA therapeutics that helps researchers quickly identify the biological mechanisms and applications of sup-tRNAs and provides a wealth of data resources and analytical tools.
