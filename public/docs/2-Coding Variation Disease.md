### Genetic Disorders

 There are many gene mutations in human genes: single base substitutions can cause nonsense mutations, missense mutations; insertion or deletion of bases can cause frameshift mutations\. These mutations can cause many diseases\.  This section collects data on diseases caused by the above three mutations, which are divided into two categories: genetic diseases and cancers, and introduces the characteristics of the diseases\.

#### 2.1 Coding Variation in Disease

The module integrates the data of genetic diseases caused by gene nonsense mutations, missense mutations, and frameshift mutations from the HGV database, including 68 nonsense mutations, 214 missense mutations, and 98 frameshift mutations\. In addition, about 200 kinds of disease information are integrated, 201 genes are involved, and 16 kinds of information such as Mutation Site, Original Codon and Amino Acid, Mutated Codon and Amino Acid, and Genome Position are summarized\. Users can gain insight into genetic disease samples and conduct research related to tRNA therapy\.

#### 2.2 Coding Variation in Cancer

The module integrates the data of cancers caused by gene nonsense mutations, missense mutations, and frameshift mutations from the COSMICS, including 361 nonsense mutations, 14982 missense mutations, and 882 frameshift mutations\. In addition, 765 kinds of disease information are integrated, 7211 genes are involved, and 11 kinds of information such as Genomic Mutation ID、Legacy Mutation ID、Mutation CDS、Mutation Locus are summarized\. Users can gain insight into cancer samples and conduct research related to tRNA therapy\.

#### Step 1：Select Diseases of Interest

Users can search for the target disease or gene in the search bar, and find the content <a id="_Hlk170562637"></a>users are interested in by selecting the disease name, gene name and other modules, and then inputting the corresponding information \(please fill in the search content completely to improve the accuracy of the search\) to search\. Moreover, users can check the information by themselves in the selection interface, so that the main interface will present the content users want, which is convenient for the comparison of information between multiple diseases\.

#### Step 2：Find disease-specific information

For a particular disease, users can click on the "\+" to display detailed information\. By clicking on the links, it is also possible to jump to references as well as data sources\. In addition, if users encounters problems during the search process, users can click on the AI assistant <a id="_Hlk170493689"></a>“Yingying” in the lower right corner of the page to seek help from it, thus increasing users experience and improving the efficiency of the search\.
