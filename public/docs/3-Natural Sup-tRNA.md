### Natural Sup-tRNA

There are various mutations in nature, such as nonsense mutations and frameshift mutations\. These mutations produce abnormal codons, resulting in aberrant translation of mRNA\. Concurrently, there are also naturally occurring suppressor tRNAs \(sup\-tRNAs\) in certain species, which can read through abnormal codons and restore protein synthesis\. 

The Natural Sup\-tRNA page catalogs these natural suppressors, which are divided into two modules based on the type of suppression: Nonsense Sup\-tRNA \(decoding nonsense codons\) and Frameshift Sup\-tRNA \(decoding quadruple codons\)\. Each module provides relevant information on sup\-tRNAs, aiming to help users quickly understand a variety of natural sup\-tRNAs and provide reference for the treatment of nonsense mutation related diseases\.

#### 3.1 Nonsense Sup-tRNA

The Nonsense Sup\-tRNA module integrates 300 articles and 50 natural sup\-tRNAs from PubMed and Saccharomyces Genome Database databases, which displays natural sup\-tRNAs information from multiple species such as humans, animals, plants, and microorganisms\. The database compiles 15 categories of information, including 20 species, 3 types of stop codons amber \(UAG\), ochre \(UAA\), opal \(UGA\), 12 noncanonical amino acids, sup\-tRNA sequences, mutation sites, modified nucleotides\. Users can use keywords such as stop codons, amino acids, and readthrough mechanism to filter relevant information and complete a rapid search\. This module aims to enhance understanding and research of sup\-tRNAs and help users to discover more sup\-tRNAs and facilitate the development of new therapeutics\.

#### 3.2 Frameshift Sup-tRNA

The Frameshift Sup\-tRNA module integrates 100 articles from the PubMed database and displays sequence information of frameshift sup\-tRNAs\. This module compiles 10 categories of information, including a variety of quadruple codons, noncanonical amino acids, sup\-tRNA sequences, and mutation sites\. Users can filter the required information according to amino acids and quadruple codons for rapid retrieval\.

#### 3.3 Search

The database provides users with an intuitive search interface, allowing users to enter keywords such as codons, species names, or amino acids to search\.

Example: Search for entries with an anticodon after mutation of CUA on the Nonsense Sup\-tRNA module\.

#### Step 1：Search

Enter the Nonsense Sup\-tRNA module, input the search term "CUA" in the search bar, select " anticodon after mutation" in the drop\-down menu to limit the search scope and achieve accurate search\.

#### Step 2：View the results

The Nonsense Sup\-tRNA module displays 4 columns by default\. Users can click on the drop\-down menu and check the information they want to view, such as "anticodon after mutation"\. 

The three columns of "Stop codon for readthrough", "Noncanonical charged amino acids" and "Readthrough mechanism" allow users to further filter entries by ticking the options\.

Click on the line of the entry to see all the information\. If users want to know more, they can click on the ID of the reference to jump to the reference page\.
