In the secondary structure of the mature tRNA, the net result is that an extra, unpaired cytidine residue is pushed into the anticodon loop, thus increasing the size of the loop to eight nucleotides.The sufJ promotes +1 shifting of the reading frame at sites in the message where any of the four-base sequences ACCA, ACCU, or ACCC are encountered in the translational frame.",6169441、6188650、6091135、25352689,6091135
