export const projectObjectives = `Project Objectives:
1. Collect types of rare genetic diseases and mutation sites applicable to tRNA therapy, serving as potential drug targets.
2. Display sequence and structural data of natural sup-tRNA (focusing on their mutation sites) to aid in discovering more natural sup-tRNAs.
3. Gather design plans for engineered tRNA molecules (highlighting their modification sites), showcasing their therapeutic effects, safety, and immunogenicity, to support subsequent experimental verification.
4. Illustrate the functions of essential elements on tRNA molecules (including sequence, structure, chemical modifications, etc.) to provide theoretical support for the design and modification of engineered tRNA.`;

export const projectContent = `Project Content:
1. Coding Variation Disease: Which diseases are suitable for tRNA therapy? What are their characteristics?
2. Natural sup-tRNA: What are the naturally occurring sup-tRNAs, in which species are they found? What are their sequences? What key positions have mutations?
3. tRNA Therapeutics: For which diseases are the current tRNA therapies mainly used? What are their design strategies? What key sites have been modified? What amino acids have been introduced? Does the resulting protein structure change? How effective are they? How safe are they?
4. tRNA Elements: What are the key elements on the tRNA molecule that determine its characteristics and functions?`;
