### Introduction

This section provides a brief introduction to ENSURE so that users are aware of the information provided by ENSURE, how to refer to it and how to contact us\.

#### 1\.1 About ENSURE

ENSURE is an encyclopedia of suppressed tRNA therapeutics equipped with an artificial intelligence assistant\. It contains genetic variants in genetic diseases and cancers from the HGV database, including those caused by missense, nonsense, and shifted\-code mutations\. ENSURE integrates relevant disease therapeutic tRNAs \(sup\-tRNAs\) mentioned in the literature, naturally\-occurring functional sup\-tRNAs, and provides detailed information on the species of origin, sequence, and structure of sup\-tRNAs\. This platform can help researchers to rapidly identify the biological mechanisms and applications of sup\-tRNAs, while providing abundant data resources and analysis tools to support the design of engineered tRNAs\.

The current version of ENSURE contains four sections:

1\. Coding Variation Disease: provides data on 66 genetic diseases caused by nonsense mutations from the HGV database, covering information on 56 diseases and 53 genes\. In addition, there are 361 cancers caused by nonsense mutations from the COSMICS database, covering 103 diseases and 268 genes\.

2\. Natural sup\-tRNAs: Natural sup\-tRNAs are included and categorized into two modules according to the type of suppression: nonsense mutation suppressor tRNAs \(Nonsense Sup\-tRNAs\) and frameshift mutation suppressor tRNAs \(Frameshift Sup\-tRNAs\)\. The Nonsense Sup\-tRNA module contains information on 50 natural sup\-tRNAs from a variety of species, including humans, plants, and microorganisms; the Frameshift Sup\-tRNA module integrates 100 publications from the PubMed database, and presents sequence information on 50 frameshift sup\-tRNAs\.

3\. tRNA Therapeutic: integrates more than 100 articles from PubMed database, and displays 700 sup\-tRNA information for nonsense mutations\. By combining RNAcentral and GtRNAdb with Blastn processing to obtain raw sequences to compare sequence mutation sites, and using tRNAscan\-SE combined with modeRNA and AlphaFold3 to obtain secondary and tertiary structures of tRNAs, which provides design guidance for users\.

4\. tRNA Element: More than 800 documents have been processed through AI\-assisted processing, providing information on studies related to more than 50 tRNA modifications, including modification sites and their functions\.

In summary, ENSURE is a comprehensive encyclopedia of integrated tRNA therapeutics that helps researchers quickly identify the biological mechanisms and applications of sup\-tRNAs and provides a wealth of data resources and analytical tools\.
