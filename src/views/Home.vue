    <h2>Project Background</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Genetic mutations (sequence, structure)</li>
      <li>Genetic mutations leading to diseases (coding variation disease)</li>
      <li>tRNA therapeutics and Genetic Code Expansion (GCE) technology</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
    <ol class="graph">
      <li>Collect types of rare genetic diseases and mutation sites applicable to tRNA therapy, serving as potential drug targets.</li>
      <li>Display sequence and structural data of natural sup-tRNA (focusing on their mutation sites) to aid in discovering more natural sup-tRNAs.</li>
      <li>Gather design plans for engineered tRNA molecules (highlighting their modification sites), showcasing their therapeutic effects, safety, and immunogenicity, to support subsequent experimental verification.</li>
      <li>Illustrate the functions of essential elements on tRNA molecules (including sequence, structure, chemical modifications, etc.) to provide theoretical support for the design and modification of engineered tRNA.</li>
